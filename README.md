## Getting Started

### Installation

Clone Litadel:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/deepweather/Litadel.git
cd Litadel
```

Create a virtual environment:
```bash
conda create -n litadel python=3.13
conda activate litadel
```

Install dependencies:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### API Keys Setup

You will need API keys for LLM providers and market data. The default configuration uses OpenAI for agents and [Alpha Vantage](https://www.alphavantage.co/support/#api-key) for market data.

Create a `.env` file in the project root:
```bash
cp .env.example .env
# Edit .env with your actual API keys
```

Or export them directly:
```bash
export OPENAI_API_KEY=$YOUR_OPENAI_API_KEY
export ALPHA_VANTAGE_API_KEY=$YOUR_ALPHA_VANTAGE_API_KEY
```

**Note:** Litadel partners with Alpha Vantage to provide robust API support. Get a free API key [here](https://www.alphavantage.co/support/#api-key)‚ÄîLitadel users receive increased rate limits (60 requests/minute, no daily limits) through Alpha Vantage's open-source support program.

## Usage

### Web Dashboard (Recommended)

The web interface provides the most comprehensive experience with real-time tracking, interactive charts, and complete analysis history.

**1. Start the API Server:**
```bash
python -m api.main
```

On first run, the system will automatically create a database and generate an API key. **Save this key‚Äîyou'll need it for the web interface.**

**2. Start the Frontend:**
```bash
cd frontend
npm install
npm run dev
```

**3. Access the Dashboard:**

Open your browser to `http://localhost:5173` and enter your API key in Settings. You're ready to create your first analysis!

### Interactive CLI

For a terminal-based experience with live agent progress tracking:

```bash
python -m cli.main
```

Select your ticker, analysis date, analyst team, LLM models, and research depth through the interactive prompts.

<p align="center">
  <img src="assets/cli/cli_init.png" width="100%" style="display: inline-block; margin: 0 2%;">
</p>

Watch as agents collaborate in real-time, with live updates showing their reasoning and tool usage:

<p align="center">
  <img src="assets/cli/cli_news.png" width="100%" style="display: inline-block; margin: 0 2%;">
</p>

<p align="center">
  <img src="assets/cli/cli_transaction.png" width="100%" style="display: inline-block; margin: 0 2%;">
</p>

Results are automatically saved to `results/<TICKER>/<DATE>/` with detailed logs and markdown reports.

### Python Package

Integrate Litadel's multi-agent analysis directly into your own applications, trading bots, or research pipelines.

**Basic Usage:**

```python
from tradingagents.graph.trading_graph import TradingAgentsGraph
from tradingagents.default_config import DEFAULT_CONFIG

# Initialize the trading agents
ta = TradingAgentsGraph(debug=True, config=DEFAULT_CONFIG.copy())

# Run analysis and get trading decision
_, decision = ta.propagate("NVDA", "2024-05-10")
print(decision)
```

**Custom Configuration:**

Customize LLM models, debate rounds, and data sources to match your needs:

```python
from tradingagents.graph.trading_graph import TradingAgentsGraph
from tradingagents.default_config import DEFAULT_CONFIG

# Create custom configuration
config = DEFAULT_CONFIG.copy()
config["deep_think_llm"] = "o1-mini"           # Deep reasoning model
config["quick_think_llm"] = "gpt-4o-mini"      # Fast operations model
config["max_debate_rounds"] = 3                # More thorough research debates

# Configure data sources
config["data_vendors"] = {
    "core_stock_apis": "yfinance",             # Price data
    "technical_indicators": "yfinance",        # Technical analysis
    "fundamental_data": "alpha_vantage",       # Company fundamentals
    "news_data": "alpha_vantage",              # News and sentiment
}

# Run with custom config
ta = TradingAgentsGraph(debug=True, config=config)
_, decision = ta.propagate("AAPL", "2024-05-10")
```

**Cost Optimization:**

For testing and development, we recommend using `gpt-4o-mini` and `o1-mini` to minimize costs, as the multi-agent framework makes numerous API calls during analysis. For production use with higher accuracy requirements, consider `gpt-4o` and `o1-preview`.

**Data Sources:**

The default configuration uses YFinance for price/technical data and Alpha Vantage for fundamentals/news. You can switch to OpenAI for web-based data fetching or use local cached data for offline experimentation. See `tradingagents/default_config.py` for all available options.

## How It Works

Litadel uses a multi-agent architecture that mirrors the structure of professional trading firms. Specialized AI agents collaborate to provide comprehensive market analysis.

</p>

### Analyst Team

Four specialized analysts evaluate different aspects of market conditions:

- **Technical Analyst** - Analyzes price patterns, trends, and technical indicators (MACD, RSI, moving averages)
- **Fundamentals Analyst** - Evaluates company financials, earnings, balance sheets, and intrinsic value
- **News Analyst** - Monitors global news, macroeconomic indicators, and their market impact
- **Sentiment Analyst** - Analyzes social media and public sentiment to gauge market mood

</p>

### Researcher Team

Bull and bear researchers critically assess analyst insights through structured debates, balancing potential gains against risks.

### Trader Agent

Synthesizes all reports and research to make informed trading decisions with clear timing and position sizing recommendations.
