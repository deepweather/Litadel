### Risk Management and Portfolio Manager
- Continuously evaluates portfolio risk by assessing market volatility, liquidity, and other risk factors. The risk management team evaluates and adjusts trading strategies, providing assessment reports to the Portfolio Manager for final decision.

## Getting Started

### Installation

Clone Litadel:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/TauricResearch/Litadel.git
cd Litadel
```

Create a virtual environment:
```bash
conda create -n litadel python=3.13
conda activate litadel
```

Install dependencies:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### API Keys Setup

You will need API keys for LLM providers and market data. The default configuration uses OpenAI for agents and [Alpha Vantage](https://www.alphavantage.co/support/#api-key) for market data.

Create a `.env` file in the project root:
```bash
cp .env.example .env
# Edit .env with your actual API keys
```

Or export them directly:
```bash
export OPENAI_API_KEY=$YOUR_OPENAI_API_KEY
export ALPHA_VANTAGE_API_KEY=$YOUR_ALPHA_VANTAGE_API_KEY
```

**Note:** Litadel partners with Alpha Vantage to provide robust API support. Get a free API key [here](https://www.alphavantage.co/support/#api-key)‚ÄîLitadel users receive increased rate limits (60 requests/minute, no daily limits) through Alpha Vantage's open-source support program.

## Usage

### Web Dashboard (Recommended)

The web interface provides the most comprehensive experience with real-time tracking, interactive charts, and complete analysis history.

**1. Start the API Server:**
```bash
python -m api.main
```

On first run, the system will automatically create a database and generate an API key. **Save this key‚Äîyou'll need it for the web interface.**

**2. Start the Frontend:**
```bash
cd frontend
npm install
npm run dev
```

**3. Access the Dashboard:**

Open your browser to `http://localhost:5173` and enter your API key in Settings. You're ready to create your first analysis!

### Interactive CLI

For a terminal-based experience with live agent progress tracking:

```bash
python -m cli.main
```

Select your ticker, analysis date, analyst team, LLM models, and research depth through the interactive prompts.

<p align="center">
  <img src="assets/cli/cli_init.png" width="100%" style="display: inline-block; margin: 0 2%;">
</p>

Watch as agents collaborate in real-time, with live updates showing their reasoning and tool usage:

<p align="center">
  <img src="assets/cli/cli_news.png" width="100%" style="display: inline-block; margin: 0 2%;">
</p>

<p align="center">
  <img src="assets/cli/cli_transaction.png" width="100%" style="display: inline-block; margin: 0 2%;">
</p>

Results are automatically saved to `results/<TICKER>/<DATE>/` with detailed logs and markdown reports.

### Python Package

Integrate Litadel's multi-agent analysis directly into your own applications, trading bots, or research pipelines.

**Basic Usage:**

```python
from tradingagents.graph.trading_graph import TradingAgentsGraph
from tradingagents.default_config import DEFAULT_CONFIG

# Initialize the trading agents
ta = TradingAgentsGraph(debug=True, config=DEFAULT_CONFIG.copy())

# Run analysis and get trading decision
_, decision = ta.propagate("NVDA", "2024-05-10")
print(decision)
```

**Custom Configuration:**

Customize LLM models, debate rounds, and data sources to match your needs:

```python
from tradingagents.graph.trading_graph import TradingAgentsGraph
from tradingagents.default_config import DEFAULT_CONFIG

# Create custom configuration
config = DEFAULT_CONFIG.copy()
config["deep_think_llm"] = "o1-mini"           # Deep reasoning model
config["quick_think_llm"] = "gpt-4o-mini"      # Fast operations model
config["max_debate_rounds"] = 3                # More thorough research debates

# Configure data sources
config["data_vendors"] = {
    "core_stock_apis": "yfinance",             # Price data
    "technical_indicators": "yfinance",        # Technical analysis
    "fundamental_data": "alpha_vantage",       # Company fundamentals
    "news_data": "alpha_vantage",              # News and sentiment
}

# Run with custom config
ta = TradingAgentsGraph(debug=True, config=config)
_, decision = ta.propagate("AAPL", "2024-05-10")
```

**Cost Optimization:**

For testing and development, we recommend using `gpt-4o-mini` and `o1-mini` to minimize costs, as the multi-agent framework makes numerous API calls during analysis. For production use with higher accuracy requirements, consider `gpt-4o` and `o1-preview`.

**Data Sources:**

The default configuration uses YFinance for price/technical data and Alpha Vantage for fundamentals/news. You can switch to OpenAI for web-based data fetching or use local cached data for offline experimentation. See `tradingagents/default_config.py` for all available options.
