# Litadel: AI-Native Hedge Fund Platform

> *Citadel was built by quants. Litadel was built by vibes.* üöÄ

> **About Litadel:** Built on the foundation of TradingAgents, Litadel is an AI-native hedge fund platform that combines deep market analysis, automated strategy generation, and rigorous backtesting. While TradingAgents provided an excellent proof-of-concept for multi-agent trading analysis, Litadel extends it into a complete trading system with: multi-asset support (stocks, crypto & commodities), AI-powered strategy code generation, secure backtesting engine, modern web interface, parallel execution, persistent storage, REST API, and portfolio management. From research to execution, Litadel handles the entire trading workflow.

## Getting Started

### Installation

Clone Litadel:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/deepweather/Litadel.git
cd Litadel
```

Create a virtual environment:
```bash
conda create -n litadel python=3.13
conda activate litadel
```

Install dependencies:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### API Keys Setup

You will need API keys for LLM providers and market data. The default configuration uses OpenAI for agents and [Alpha Vantage](https://www.alphavantage.co/support/#api-key) for market data.

Create a `.env` file in the project root:
```bash
cp .env.example .env
# Edit .env with your actual API keys
```

Or export them directly:
```bash
export OPENAI_API_KEY=$YOUR_OPENAI_API_KEY
export ALPHA_VANTAGE_API_KEY=$YOUR_ALPHA_VANTAGE_API_KEY
```

**Note:** Litadel partners with Alpha Vantage to provide robust API support. Get a free API key [here](https://www.alphavantage.co/support/#api-key)‚ÄîLitadel users receive increased rate limits (60 requests/minute, no daily limits) through Alpha Vantage's open-source support program.

## Usage

### Web Dashboard (Recommended)

The web interface provides the most comprehensive experience with real-time tracking, interactive charts, and complete analysis history.

**1. Start the API Server:**
```bash
python -m api.main
```

On first run, the system will automatically create a database and generate an API key. **Save this key‚Äîyou'll need it for the web interface.**

**2. Start the Frontend:**
```bash
cd frontend
npm install
npm run dev
```

**3. Access the Dashboard:**

Open your browser to `http://localhost:5173` and enter your API key in Settings. You're ready to create your first analysis!

### Interactive CLI

For a terminal-based experience with live progress tracking and arrow-key navigation:

```bash
# Launch interactive menu
litadel-cli

# Or run directly
litadel-cli analyze    # Deep dive market analysis
litadel-cli backtest   # Strategy backtesting
```

The Litadel CLI provides a rich, interactive terminal interface with:
- **Arrow-key navigation** for all menus and selections
- **Step-by-step workflows** for analysis and backtesting
- **Live agent progress** showing reasoning and tool usage in real-time
- **Syntax-highlighted code** for generated strategies
- **Formatted results** with colors and panels

<p align="center">
  <img src="assets/litadel_cli.png" width="100%">
</p>

**Analysis Workflow:**
1. Select ticker and date
2. Choose analyst team
3. Configure LLM models
4. Watch agents collaborate
5. Get trading recommendation

**Backtest Workflow:**
1. Enter ticker and date range
2. Describe strategy in plain English
3. AI generates Python code
4. Docker sandbox validates (auto-fixes errors)
5. Run backtest
6. See performance metrics and profit/loss

Results are automatically saved to `results/<TICKER>/<DATE>/` with detailed logs and markdown reports.

### Python Package

Integrate Litadel's multi-agent analysis directly into your own applications, trading bots, or research pipelines.

**Basic Usage:**

```python
from litadel.graph.trading_graph import TradingAgentsGraph
from litadel.default_config import DEFAULT_CONFIG

# Initialize the trading agents
litadel = TradingAgentsGraph(debug=True, config=DEFAULT_CONFIG.copy())

# Run analysis and get trading decision
_, decision = litadel.propagate("NVDA", "2024-05-10")
print(decision)
```

**Custom Configuration:**

Customize LLM models, debate rounds, and data sources to match your needs:

```python
from litadel.graph.trading_graph import TradingAgentsGraph
from litadel.default_config import DEFAULT_CONFIG

# Create custom configuration
config = DEFAULT_CONFIG.copy()
config["deep_think_llm"] = "o1-mini"           # Deep reasoning model
config["quick_think_llm"] = "gpt-4o-mini"      # Fast operations model
config["max_debate_rounds"] = 3                # More thorough research debates

# Configure data sources
config["data_vendors"] = {
    "core_stock_apis": "yfinance",             # Price data
    "technical_indicators": "yfinance",        # Technical analysis
    "fundamental_data": "alpha_vantage",       # Company fundamentals
    "news_data": "alpha_vantage",              # News and sentiment
}

# Run with custom config
litadel = TradingAgentsGraph(debug=True, config=config)
_, decision = litadel.propagate("AAPL", "2024-05-10")
```

**Cost Optimization:**

For testing and development, we recommend using `gpt-4o-mini` and `o1-mini` to minimize costs, as the multi-agent framework makes numerous API calls during analysis. For production use with higher accuracy requirements, consider `gpt-4o` and `o1-preview`.

**Data Sources:**

The default configuration uses YFinance for price/technical data and Alpha Vantage for fundamentals/news. You can switch to OpenAI for web-based data fetching or use local cached data for offline experimentation. See `litadel/default_config.py` for all available options.

</p>

**CLI:**
```bash
litadel-cli backtest

# Follow prompts:
# - Ticker: BTC
# - Dates: 2023-01-01 to 2023-12-31
# - Strategy: "SMA crossover strategy"
# - Capital: 50000
# - Commission: 0.002
```

**Python API:**
```python
from litadel.backtest import BacktestConfig, BacktestEngine

config = BacktestConfig(
    symbol="AAPL",
    start_date="2023-01-01",
    end_date="2023-12-31",
    strategy_class_code="""
from backtesting import Strategy
from backtesting.lib import crossover
from backtesting.test import SMA

class SmaCross(Strategy):
    n1 = 10
    n2 = 20

    def init(self):
        self.sma1 = self.I(SMA, self.data.Close, self.n1)
        self.sma2 = self.I(SMA, self.data.Close, self.n2)

    def next(self):
        if crossover(self.sma1, self.sma2):
            if not self.position:
                self.buy()
        elif crossover(self.sma2, self.sma1):
            if self.position:
                self.position.close()
""",
    initial_capital=100000,
    commission=0.002,
)

engine = BacktestEngine()
result = engine.execute(config)

print(f"Return: {result.total_return_pct:.2f}%")
print(f"Sharpe: {result.sharpe_ratio:.2f}")
print(f"Trades: {result.num_trades}")
```

### Current Limitations

- **Single-ticker only** - Multi-ticker portfolio strategies coming soon
- **No live trading** - Backtests only (live execution in development)
- **Docker required** - For secure strategy validation (falls back to basic checks if unavailable)

## How It Works

Litadel uses a multi-agent architecture that mirrors the structure of professional trading firms. Specialized AI agents collaborate to provide comprehensive market analysis.

<p align="center">
  <img src="assets/schema.png" width="100%">
</p>

### Analyst Team

Four specialized analysts evaluate different aspects of market conditions:

- **Technical Analyst** - Analyzes price patterns, trends, and technical indicators (MACD, RSI, moving averages)
- **Fundamentals Analyst** - Evaluates company financials, earnings, balance sheets, and intrinsic value
- **News Analyst** - Monitors global news, macroeconomic indicators, and their market impact
- **Sentiment Analyst** - Analyzes social media and public sentiment to gauge market mood

<p align="center">
  <img src="assets/analyst.png" width="100%">

### Researcher Team

Bull and bear researchers critically assess analyst insights through structured debates, balancing potential gains against risks.
